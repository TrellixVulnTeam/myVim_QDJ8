GitHub color scheme for Vim
===========================

Source code for [vim-github-theme].

[vim-github-theme]: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2855

This is a port of GitHub's lovely light-background syntax highlighting theme.
It is as comprehensive as possible.
It should look good with:

- Completion menus
- Diffsplit
- STL highlighting

It's not an exact replica, but it's pretty close.
Enjoy!
